<h1>Hi</h1>

<p>I'm Martijn Stegeman. My ususal occupation is teaching programming to students who have never programmed before (and then some more). Aside from teaching, I sometimes find time to do research projects with (on!) my students, allowing me to precisely describe teaching practices, hopefully finding leads on how to do it better than before.</p>

<p>My work environment is the University of Amsterdam, and especially the <a href="https://www.mprog.nl/">Programming Lab</a>. If you're a teacher and you'd like a tour of our labs to better understand how we teach students, feel free to ask!</p>

<p>Previously, I have advised students during their final research projects for a bachelor's program. If you're a student who is keen on charting how we teach (and maybe should not teach?) programming, do get in touch!</p>
