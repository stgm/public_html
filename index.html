<h1>Hi</h1>

<p>I'm Martijn Stegeman. My ususal occupation is teaching programming to students who have never programmed before (and then some more). Apart from teaching, I sometimes find time to do research projects with (on!) my students, allowing me to precisely describe teaching practices, hopefully finding leads on how to do it better than before. My main focus is on describing code quality and how it may be used in computer science classrooms.</p>

<h2>Lab</h2>

<p>My work environment is the University of Amsterdam, and especially the <a href="https://www.mprog.nl/">Programming Lab</a>. If you're a teacher and you'd like a tour of our labs to better understand how we teach students, feel free to ask!</p>

<h2>Graduating with me</h2>

<p>Previously, I have advised students during their graduation research projects at the bachelor's level. If you're a student who is keen on charting how we teach (and maybe should not teach?) programming, do get in touch!</p>
