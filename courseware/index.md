# Open courseware

Most courses I teach use open courseware, available under a creative commons license, either re-mixed from other universities or created be my and my team.

## Programming / CS50

These courses are mostly based on a course that has become dear to my heart (and that of many students): [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) from Harvard's David Malan. It starts off with Scratch and boldly goes on using C, which some would say is quite a leap. However, C has proven to be a small language that is fundamentally linked to many computer science concepts. We have added a sequence on object-oriented programming to prepare students for further study.

## App Studio

This course is a mix of a lot of existing material and some new. Harvard's [CS164](http://cs164.tv/2012/spring/) by David Malan is a project-based technical course, focusing on getting students up to speed with software engineering concepts and tools, while learning about a specific mobile development platform (iOS or Android). We added many assignments, of which many are based on Marty Stepp's [CS193a](http://cs193a.stanford.edu/) at Stanford.
