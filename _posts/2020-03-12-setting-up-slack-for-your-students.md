Our goal is to provide students an environment where they can help each other. This is why traditionally, in our [Minor Programmeren](https://www.mprog.nl/) programming courses, we require attendance for substantial hours, up until 40 hours a week.

Because we currently don't want students to be [on campus](https://www.uva.nl/), we need other solutions. To allow students to help each other out in times of frustration, or simply to resolve a bug, we provide Slack. Here is the why and how.

## Why Slack?

We want to provide an easy entry for students who haven't used online communications much. In Slack, which is mostly text-based, it's easy to join and lurk around a little. You don't have to participate right away.

However, Slack also allows person-to-person chats and even audio calls with screen sharing. Simply click another user's name and press "Call". Person-to-person chat can't be disabled, which is why we have most staff **not** join the Slack account. We want to avoid situations where staff is seen as "permanently available". (However, we will be using an online planning tool via which students can book a 1-on-1 video chat with a teaching assistant.) 

## One Slack for our programming courses

We decided to put all students of our programming-related courses together. These are often students that are currently in a fulltime programming course, or they come from different parts of the university. **In general**, we would recommend creating a Slack account for each study programme, or for each cohort of students.

## One big channel per course

To facilitate quick and low-bar discussions about our courses, we created channels for each course.

- Web programming (multiple groups of students doing roughly the same course)
- Parttime programming (introductory courses in parttime)
- Fulltime programming (introductory courses in fulltime)
- Scientific programming (an introductory course with a different approach)
- Collective intelligence (an advanced course for a different audience)

## Optionally, channels for groups of students

In Collective Intelligence, students will be teaming up in groups of three. These students need a way to convey their progress on their projects to course leaders. Creating a channel for each group also gives them a natural place to discuss between them.

## Settings

- We keep the `general` channel for very general announcements; for example about the technical infrastructure that's shared by all courses. We disable posting to `general` by anyone other than admins. (See "Manage posting permissions" in the channel options.)

- We restrict all channel management options to admins only., including the creation of new channels. If students want, they can still create multi-person chats. However, we ask them to talk about the course in the public channels as much as possible.
